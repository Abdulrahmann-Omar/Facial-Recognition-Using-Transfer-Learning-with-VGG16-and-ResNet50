# Facial-Recognition-Using-Transfer-Learning-with-VGG16-and-ResNet50
This project uses transfer learning with VGG16 and ResNet50 to classify facial images. A facial recognition dataset is preprocessed and split for training, validation, and testing. Model performance is evaluated and compared based on accuracy and loss across epochs.
